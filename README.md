Programmed with Javascript after learning DOM manipulation for 2 weeks or so. This is a two-player dice game where each player takes turns rolling the dice. The goal is to reach a total score of 100. If a player rolls a 1, their current score is reset to zero, and it becomes the other player's turn. Click 'New Game' to start a new match.
